# ClassSync Nexus Hub

## 🚀 Project Overview

ClassSync Nexus Hub is an advanced educational platform that seamlessly integrates course management, collaborative learning, and AI-powered assistance. The platform leverages cutting-edge technologies to create an intuitive and efficient learning environment.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend Architecture (Contributed by Prabath)
The frontend is built using a modern React-based stack with TypeScript, emphasizing type safety and component reusability.

#### Key Technologies
- **React 18** - For building a reactive and component-based UI
- **TypeScript** - Ensuring type safety and better developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for responsive design
- **Shadcn/ui** - Accessible and customizable component library
- **Vite** - Next-generation frontend tooling for faster development
- **React Query** - For efficient server state management
- **Zustand** - Lightweight state management solution

└── integrations/     # Third-party service integrations
```

### Backend Architecture (Contributed by Mihisara)
The backend utilizes Supabase for robust data management and authentication.

#### Key Technologies
- **Supabase**
  - Real-time Database
  - Authentication
  - Storage
  - Edge Functions
- **PostgreSQL** - Advanced relational database
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - For granular data access control

#### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core Tables
courses
  id uuid primary key
  title text
  description text
  subject text
  semester text
  year integer
  created_at timestamp
  creator_id uuid references auth.users

notes
  id uuid primary key
  title text
  content text
  file_url text
  course_id uuid references courses
  user_id uuid references auth.users
  is_public boolean
  created_at timestamp

user_roles
  user_id uuid references auth.users
  role text check (role in ('learner', 'contributor', 'admin'))
  created_at timestamp
```

### AI Integration Architecture (Contributed by Mihisara)
The AI system is designed for intelligent content processing and user assistance.

#### Technologies Used
- **OpenAI GPT-4** - For advanced text processing and generation
- **Supabase Edge Functions** - For serverless AI processing
- **Vector Embeddings** - For semantic search capabilities

#### AI Features
1. **Content Enhancement**
   - Automatic content summarization
   - Key points extraction
   - Study material generation

2. **Smart Search**
   - Semantic search across notes
   - Context-aware query processing
   - Personalized content recommendations

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow
1. User authentication through Supabase Auth
2. Role-based access control using custom claims
3. Secure session management with JWT tokens

### Data Flow

    A[Client] --> B[React Components]
    B --> C[React Query]
    C --> D[Supabase Client]
    D --> E[Supabase Backend]
    E --> F[PostgreSQL]
    E --> G[File Storage]
    E --> H[Edge Functions]
    H --> I[OpenAI API]
```

### Security Measures
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- JWT-based authentication
- Secure file upload validation
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Environment variable encryption

## 🚀 Performance Optimizations

### Frontend
- Code splitting using React.lazy()
- Optimized asset loading
- Memoized components
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Service Worker for offline capabilities

### Backend
- Database indexing
- Query optimization
- Caching strategies
- Connection pooling
- Rate limiting
